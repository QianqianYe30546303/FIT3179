             <h2>Number of properties for sale vs. actually sold by suburb</h2>
             <p>
                The left visualisation shows
                the number of for-sale properties per hundred in each suburb. 
                This reflects the population and housing mobility in the corresponding suburb and whether 
                it is a popular place for people to invest in real estates from 2016 to 2018
                to some extent.

                <br/>
                <br/>
                

                By contrast, as shown in the visualisation on the right hand side, the variation of the 
                number of properties being successfully sold per hundred across Melbourne is presented with extreme
                values highlighed in yellow (minimal conversion rate) and darker red (higher conversion rate) to assist 
                investment decision making.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                
                It has shown that in general, different from the variation that an increasing 
                proportion of properties were for sale as it approaches the metropolitan and the regioinal 
                area has a smaller housing market and lower mobility, 
                properties located in regional Melbourne were more likely to be sold.

            <h2>Median Housing Price Growth in Greater Melbourne over Quarters</h2>
            <p>There had been an overwhelming downward trend in median housing price in Melbourne
              with far greater negative quarter-over-quarter growth rate from 2016 to 2018 comparing to positive growth.
              <br/>
            
                Looking at the figure each year, only median housing price in 2016 has shown a positive growth rate.
                Both the year of 2017 and 2018 had an overall negative growth rate and appeared to continue 
                to fall at a rapid pace. This is a warning signal for the potential house buyers to be cautious with their 
                purchase decision making if they do consider this as an investment.
                <br/>

            <h2>Which suburbs had the most housing price growth?</h2>
            <p>
              Heathmont was ranked first for the growth rate in housing transaction price over 2016-2018 with a staggering surge over 
              129% from 2016 to 2018, far ahead of the rest of suburbs Melbourne wise.  
              <br/>
            
              It is noted that the gap between each suburb's price growth narrows down as the rank number goes down.

          <h2>How is housing price affected by its attributes?</h2>
          <p>
          With respect to the location, there is a general trend that the house was sold at a higher price as 
          it is closer to the Melbourne CBD. Most properties sold clustered in between 5 to 25 km away from the CBD.
          
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Units are smaller in size and generally closer to the CBD at a lower price range under $0.8M. 
          Unit price is also the least correlated with the distance. It usually depends on the size of the property (bedroom number).
          <br/>
          House prices are very much related to its location. Plenty of them within 5km from the CBD 
          were sold high even with a smaller size. For those located further than 3km from CBD, size is also an highly key factor
          that affects the price.
          </br>
          Townhouses usually have a room number of 2-3, mostly located within 18km from the CBD. Similar to houses, generally, it had a higher
          price if located close to CBD, however, can
          be easily purchased at a lower price range between $500K and $1M.
